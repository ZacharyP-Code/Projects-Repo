<h1>Behind the Scenes of the WoW Economy</h1>

<p>
The economy in World of Warcraft is driven by player activity.
Items are farmed, crafted, traded, and sold through the Auction House.
Developers design systems that allow supply and demand to naturally
influence item pricing.
</p>

<p>
Game updates and expansions can dramatically impact market prices.
New patches may increase demand for certain materials,
while changes to crafting systems may reduce the value of others.
This creates a dynamic economic environment similar to real-world markets.
</p>

<p>
By studying how the in-game economy functions, players can better
understand financial concepts such as market cycles, speculation,
and investment strategy.
