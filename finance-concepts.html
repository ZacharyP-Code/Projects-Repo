<h1>Finance Concepts Using the WoW Economy</h1>

<h2>Supply and Demand</h2>
<p>
In the Auction House, when many players farm the same item,
supply increases and prices drop. When items are rare or needed
for raids, demand increases and prices rise.
</p>

<h2>Investing Strategy</h2>
<p>
Players can purchase undervalued materials and resell them later
at higher prices. This mirrors real-world investing strategies
based on buying low and selling high.
</p>

<h2>Risk and Reward</h2>
<p>
Not every investment works. Market prices can change based on
patches, updates, or player behavior. Higher potential profits
often come with higher risk.
